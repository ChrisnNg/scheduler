# Interview Scheduler

A React.js based single-paged application with a persistent database to help schedule interviews.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

#### Running Webpack Development Server

```sh
npm start
```

#### Running Storybook Visual Testbed

```sh
npm run storybook
```

### Prerequisites

Follow the instructions and install the Scheduler API at [Scheduler API](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/scheduler-api)

After that is complete, make sure to run the API server with `npm start` while within the API directory. Please note that both of these must be up as the application counts on the API to contain the database it draws from!
